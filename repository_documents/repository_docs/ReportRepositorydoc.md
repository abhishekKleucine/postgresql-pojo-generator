### Key Repository Usage Patterns

#### Pattern: findById() for Report Configuration Retrieval
```yaml
Usage: reportRepository.findById(id)
Purpose: "Retrieve report configuration for report generation and dashboard integration"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Used in ReportService for report configuration retrieval during report generation and dashboard operations
  2. Provides report metadata and configuration for report processing and analytics operations
  3. Critical for report operations requiring specific report configuration and parameter settings
  4. Used in report generation workflows for accessing report configuration and dashboard integration settings
  5. Enables report configuration management with report metadata and parameter configuration for analytics operations

Transaction: Not Required (MongoDB single document operations)
Error Handling: Returns empty Optional if report configuration not found
```

#### Pattern: save() for Report Configuration Management
```yaml
Usage: reportRepository.save(report)
Purpose: "Create new report configurations, update report settings, and manage report lifecycle"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Used for report configuration creation with report metadata, parameter settings, and facility associations
  2. Handles report configuration updates including parameter configuration, payload updates, and report settings
  3. Updates report configuration information for report management and analytics operations
  4. Critical for report configuration lifecycle management and dashboard integration operations
  5. Supports report configuration operations with comprehensive report metadata and parameter management

Transaction: Not Required (MongoDB ACID operations for single documents)
Error Handling: WriteException for MongoDB constraint violations
```

#### Pattern: Report Configuration for Analytics Integration
```yaml
Usage: Report configurations for dashboard and analytics integration
Purpose: "Provide report configuration for business intelligence and analytics operations"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Report configurations enable dashboard integration and analytics operations with parameter-based reporting
  2. Report metadata supports report categorization and report type-based processing for analytics workflows
  3. Parameter-based reporting enables dynamic report generation with facility-scoped analytics
  4. Report payload configuration supports dashboard integration and resource management for analytics
  5. Facility-scoped reporting enables multi-tenant analytics and facility-specific reporting operations

Transaction: Not Required for configuration retrieval
Error Handling: Configuration validation and report metadata verification
```

## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Business Layer Analysis)

### Pattern: Report Configuration Retrieval for Dashboard Integration
```yaml
Usage: findById(id) for report configuration access
Purpose: "Retrieve report configuration for dashboard integration and analytics operations"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Report configuration retrieval enables dashboard integration and analytics operations with report metadata
  2. Report configuration provides necessary information for report generation and dashboard display
  3. Report metadata supports report processing and analytics integration for business intelligence
  4. Configuration retrieval enables report parameter management and facility-scoped analytics
  5. Report configuration access supports dashboard integration and analytics workflow operations

Common Usage Examples:
  - reportRepository.findById(id) in ReportService for report configuration retrieval
  - Report configuration access for dashboard integration and analytics operations
  - Report metadata retrieval for report generation and analytics processing
  - Configuration-based report processing for business intelligence and reporting
  - Report configuration management for dashboard and analytics integration

Transaction: Not Required
Error Handling: Returns empty Optional for missing report configurations
```

### Pattern: Report Configuration Management for Analytics
```yaml
Usage: Report configuration management for analytics and dashboard operations
Purpose: "Manage report configurations for business intelligence and analytics integration"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Report configuration management enables analytics integration and dashboard configuration
  2. Report metadata management supports report categorization and analytics processing
  3. Parameter-based reporting configuration enables dynamic analytics and facility-scoped reporting
  4. Report payload management supports dashboard integration and resource configuration
  5. Facility association enables multi-tenant analytics and facility-specific reporting operations

  - tokenExpiration: Optional, integer for token expiration time in minutes
  - payload: Optional, map for report configuration payload and dashboard integration
  - facilityId: Optional, facility identifier for facility-scoped reporting and analytics

Business Constraints:
  - Report configurations must have valid metadata for report processing and analytics integration
  - Report type classification must be consistent for analytics processing and report categorization
  - Parameter configuration must be properly set for dynamic reporting and analytics operations
  - Token expiration must be valid for report access control and security requirements
  - Payload configuration must contain valid data for dashboard integration and resource management
  - Facility associations must be accurate for multi-tenant reporting and analytics scoping
  - Report configuration changes must maintain compatibility with dashboard and analytics integration
  - Report metadata must support business intelligence requirements and analytics processing
  - Configuration validation must ensure report functionality and dashboard integration
  - Report lifecycle management must maintain configuration consistency and analytics integration
```

## MongoDB-Specific Considerations

### Document Structure
```yaml
Collection: report
Document Type: Report with flexible payload structure for dashboard integration
Indexing Strategy:
  - Index on name for report identification and discovery
  - Index on type for report categorization and analytics processing
  - Index on facilityId for facility-scoped reporting and analytics
  - Index on useParameters for parameter-based report filtering

Performance Optimization:
  - Simple document structure for efficient report configuration retrieval
  - Facility-based indexing for multi-tenant reporting and analytics operations
  - Type-based indexing for report categorization and processing optimization
  - Parameter-based indexing for dynamic reporting and analytics filtering
```

### Data Consistency
```yaml
Consistency Model: Eventually consistent with MongoDB replication
Referential Integrity: Application-level enforcement for facility references
Schema Validation: MongoDB schema validation for document structure and report configuration
Migration Strategy: Document versioning for schema evolution and report configuration changes
```

## Report Configuration Considerations

Facility Scoping: Multi-tenant reporting with facility-based analytics and reporting
Dynamic Reporting: Parameter-based reporting for flexible analytics and business intelligence
Configuration Management: Report configuration lifecycle for analytics integration and dashboard operations
Integration Support: Dashboard and analytics integration through report configuration and metadata
```

### Operational Reporting
```yaml
Report Discovery: Report identification and categorization for operational reporting
