# IUserGroupAuditRepository - Complete DAO Migration Documentation

## Repository Overview
- **Entity**: UserGroupAudit (extends BaseEntity)
- **Primary Purpose**: Manages user group audit entities for user group change tracking with audit trail functionality, organization-facility audit management, and user group modification auditing
- **Key Relationships**: No direct entity relationships - stores audit data with foreign key references to organisations, facilities, user groups, and users
- **Performance Characteristics**: Moderate to high query volume with paginated audit retrieval, dynamic filtering operations, and audit lifecycle management
- **Business Context**: User group audit management component that provides user group change tracking, audit trail functionality, organization-facility audit management, and user group modification auditing for compliance and change management workflows

## Specification-Based Query Examples

### Common Audit Filtering Patterns
```java
// Organization-scoped audits
Specification<UserGroupAudit> orgSpec = (root, query, cb) -> 
    cb.equal(root.get("organisationsId"), organisationId);

// Facility-scoped audits  
Specification<UserGroupAudit> facilitySpec = (root, query, cb) -> 
    cb.equal(root.get("facilityId"), facilityId);

// User group specific audits
Specification<UserGroupAudit> userGroupSpec = (root, query, cb) -> 
    cb.equal(root.get("userGroupId"), userGroupId);

// Time-range audits
Specification<UserGroupAudit> timeRangeSpec = (root, query, cb) -> 
    cb.between(root.get("triggeredAt"), startTime, endTime);

// Triggered by user audits
Specification<UserGroupAudit> triggeredBySpec = (root, query, cb) -> 
    cb.equal(root.get("triggeredBy"), userId);

// Combined specifications
Specification<UserGroupAudit> combinedSpec = orgSpec.and(facilitySpec).and(timeRangeSpec);
```

This comprehensive documentation provides the foundation needed to implement an exact DAO layer replacement for the UserGroupAudit repository without JPA/Hibernate dependencies, focusing on audit trail management and specification-based dynamic querying patterns.
