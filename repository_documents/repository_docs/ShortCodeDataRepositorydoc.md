## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Business Layer Analysis)

### Pattern: Entity Object Short Code Management
```yaml
Usage: Complete entity object short code management for entity identification and short code functionality
Purpose: "Manage entity object short codes for comprehensive identification functionality and entity processing"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Entity object short code management provides identification functionality through short code generation, association management, and lookup operations
  2. Short code lifecycle includes code generation, entity association, and lookup management for identification control
  3. Short code management operations require entity processing for short code lifecycle and identification control
  4. Entity operations enable comprehensive identification functionality with short code capabilities and management
  5. Short code lifecycle management supports entity requirements and functionality for entity object identification processing

Common Usage Examples:
  - shortCodeDataRepository.findByData_ObjectId() for entity object short code retrieval
  - shortCodeDataRepository.save() for short code creation and updates
  - shortCodeDataRepository.findByShortCodeAndFacilityId() for facility-scoped validation
  - shortCodeDataRepository.findByShortCode() for short code validation
  - Entity object short code association with embedded ShortCodeData

Transaction: Not Required (MongoDB document-level consistency)
Error Handling: Entity short code management error handling and association validation verification
```

### Pattern: Facility-Scoped Short Code Management
```yaml
Usage: Facility-scoped short code management for multi-tenant short code isolation and facility functionality
Purpose: "Manage facility-scoped short codes for comprehensive facility functionality and short code processing"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Facility-scoped short code management operations require comprehensive short code access for facility-level identification management and short code functionality

  3. Facility-level short code operations ensure proper identification functionality through short code management and facility control
  4. Facility workflows coordinate short code management with facility processing for comprehensive facility operations
  5. Short code management supports facility requirements and functionality for comprehensive facility short code management

Common Usage Examples:
  - shortCodeDataRepository.findByShortCodeAndFacilityId() for facility-scoped short code retrieval
  - Facility isolation with compound unique index on (shortCode, facilityId)
  - Multi-tenant short code management with facility scoping
  - Facility-specific short code validation and lookup

Transaction: Not Required for facility operations
Error Handling: Facility short code management error handling and scope validation verification
```

### Pattern: Short Code Validation and Lookup
```yaml
Usage: Short code validation and lookup for entity identification and short code verification functionality
Purpose: "Validate and lookup short codes for comprehensive identification functionality and verification processing"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Short code validation operations require comprehensive short code access for validation-level identification management and verification functionality
  2. Validation management supports identification requirements and functionality for verification processing workflows
  3. Validation-level short code operations ensure proper identification functionality through short code management and validation control
  4. Verification workflows coordinate validation management with short code processing for comprehensive verification operations
  5. Validation management supports identification requirements and functionality for comprehensive short code validation management

Common Usage Examples:
  - shortCodeDataRepository.findByShortCode() for short code existence validation
  - Short code uniqueness verification for entity identification
  - Quick lookup functionality for entity object identification
  - Short code modification and validation workflows

Transaction: Not Required for validation operations
Error Handling: Short code validation error handling and lookup verification
```

## Transaction Requirements
```yaml
Read-Only Methods: 
  - findById, findAll, findByData_ObjectId, findByShortCode, findByShortCodeAndFacilityId, existsById, count

Transactional Methods:
  - save, saveAll, delete, deleteById (MongoDB document-level consistency)

Isolation Level: MongoDB default consistency
Timeout: MongoDB default timeout
Rollback: MongoDB document-level operations
```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml
Common Exceptions:
  - MongoException: MongoDB connection and operation failures
  - DocumentNotFoundException: Short code not found for specified criteria
  - DuplicateShortCodeException: Duplicate short code for facility combination
  - InvalidShortCodeException: Invalid short code format or configuration
  - ResourceNotFoundException: Entity object not found for short code validation

Validation Rules:
  - id: ObjectId identifier for short code identification
  - data: Valid ShortCodeData object for entity object association
  - shortCode: String identifier for short code value and lookup
  - facilityId: Valid facility identifier for short code scoping
  - data.objectId: Valid entity object identifier for association

Business Constraints:
  - Short code must be unique within facility context (compound unique index)
  - Facility reference should be valid for proper short code scoping
  - Entity object association must be valid for short code functionality
  - Short code format must support identification requirements
  - Short code configuration must maintain referential integrity
  - Facility isolation must be maintained for multi-tenant functionality
  - Entity object association must support identification workflows
  - Embedded data must maintain consistency with entity objects
  - Audit fields must be maintained for change tracking
  - Short code generation must follow identification standards
```

## MongoDB Short Code Collection Considerations

Performance: Optimized for short code lookup with embedded entity object data
Scalability: Horizontal scaling support through MongoDB sharding on short code ID
```

### Entity Object Integration
```yaml
Embedded Data: Entity object data stored as embedded ShortCodeData within short code documents
Entity Association: Short code definitions enable entity object identification and association
Data Consistency: Embedded data ensures short code and entity object consistency
Object Identification: Short codes provide quick lookup functionality for entity object identification
Association Management: Short code management supports entity object association and identification workflows
```

### Facility Isolation and Multi-Tenancy
```yaml
Facility Scoping: Short codes enable facility-scoped identification through facility ID association
Multi-Tenant Support: Compound unique index supports multi-tenant short code isolation
Tenant Isolation: Facility-based short code scoping ensures proper tenant isolation
Scope Management: Facility scoping enables comprehensive multi-tenant short code management
Isolation Control: Facility isolation supports multi-tenant identification and access control
```

### Short Code Lifecycle Management
```yaml
Code Generation: Short code generation for entity object identification and association
Lookup Functionality: Short code lookup enables quick entity object identification and retrieval
Validation Support: Short code validation ensures identification integrity and functionality
Modification Management: Short code modification supports identification updates and changes
Lifecycle Control: Short code lifecycle management supports identification workflow evolution
```

This comprehensive documentation provides the foundation needed to implement an exact DAO layer replacement for the ShortCodeData repository without MongoDB dependencies, focusing on entity object identification and facility-scoped short code management patterns.
