# ITrainedUsersProcessPermissionMappingRepository - Complete DAO Migration Documentation

## Repository Overview
- **Entity**: TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping (extends UserAuditIdentifiableBase)
- **Primary Purpose**: Manages trained user process permission mapping entities for training permission management with trained user permission assignment, process permission tracking, and training access control functionality
- **Key Relationships**: Links TrainedUser and ProcessPermission entities for comprehensive training permission management and access control workflows
- **Performance Characteristics**: Low query volume with permission lifecycle management and training access control operations (currently unused but designed for future training permission workflows)
- **Business Context**: Training permission management component designed for trained user process permission workflows, training access control, permission assignment tracking, and process permission functionality for training compliance and access management processes

```

## Actual Usage Patterns (Current Status)

### Pattern: Repository Placeholder - No Current Implementation
```yaml
Usage: Repository interface exists but no current business layer implementation
Purpose: "Designed as placeholder for future trained user process permission workflows and training access control functionality"

Current Status:
  1. Repository interface defined with standard JPA methods but no custom query methods implemented
  2. No current usage found in service layer indicating placeholder status for future training permission workflow functionality
  3. Entity design suggests intended use for trained user permission assignment tracking and training access control workflows
  4. Repository designed with transaction management for future training permission operations and access control management
  5. Interface prepared for future implementation of training permission functionality and access control validation requirements

Implementation Readiness:
  - Repository interface: Complete ✅
  - Entity model: Complete ✅  
  - Service integration: Not implemented ⏳
  - Custom methods: Not implemented ⏳
  - Business workflows: Not implemented ⏳

Future Implementation Requirements:
  - Custom query methods for permission retrieval and filtering
  - Service layer integration for training permission workflow management
  - Business logic implementation for access control validation
  - Workflow integration for training permission processing
  - Permission tracking functionality for training access control

Transaction: Standard JPA transaction handling currently, designed for future permission workflow error management
Error Handling: Standard JPA error handling currently, designed for future training permission workflow error management
```

## Transaction Requirements
```yaml
Read-Only Methods: 
  - findById, findAll, existsById, count

Transactional Methods:
  - save, saveAll, delete, deleteById

Isolation Level: READ_COMMITTED (default)
Timeout: 30 seconds
Rollback: Exception.class (all exceptions trigger rollback)
```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml
Common Exceptions:
  - DataIntegrityViolationException: 
    * NOT NULL constraint violations (process_permissions_id, trained_users_id)
    * Foreign key violations (invalid process_permissions_id, trained_users_id references)
    * Unique constraint violations for permission assignment combinations
    * Training permission assignment integrity constraint violations
  - EntityNotFoundException: Trained user process permission mapping not found by ID or criteria
  - OptimisticLockException: Concurrent trained user process permission mapping modifications
  - InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Invalid query parameters or permission context
  - ConstraintViolationException: Trained user process permission mapping constraint violations

Validation Rules:
  - processPermission: Required, must reference existing process permission for permission assignment context
  - processPermissionId: Derived from process permission relationship, immutable for permission context integrity
  - trainedUser: Required, must reference existing trained user for training assignment context
  - trainedUserId: Derived from trained user relationship, immutable for training context integrity

Business Constraints (Designed):
  - Trained user process permission mappings designed to be unique per trained user and process permission for proper permission assignment integrity
  - Process permission and trained user references must be valid for permission integrity and training functionality
  - Trained user process permission mappings intended to support training permission workflow requirements and access control functionality
  - Permission assignment lifecycle management designed to maintain referential integrity and training permission workflow functionality consistency
  - Permission assignment management intended to ensure proper training permission workflow control and access control functionality
  - Trained user permission associations designed to support training requirements and access control functionality for training processing
  - Permission operations intended to maintain transaction consistency and constraint integrity for training access control management
  - Permission lifecycle management designed to maintain training permission functionality and assignment consistency
  - Assignment management intended to maintain trained user permission integrity and training permission workflow requirements
  - Access control operations designed to ensure proper training permission workflow management and training access control
```

## Future Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1 - Core Permission Methods

List<TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping> findByTrainedUserId(Long trainedUserId)
List<TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping> findByProcessPermissionId(Long processPermissionId)
boolean existsByTrainedUserIdAndProcessPermissionId(Long trainedUserId, Long processPermissionId)
```

### Phase 2 - Advanced Permission Features
```java
// Advanced permission management methods  
List<TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping> findByTrainedUser_ChecklistId(Long checklistId)
List<TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping> findByTrainedUser_FacilityId(Long facilityId)
void deleteByTrainedUserId(Long trainedUserId)
void deleteByProcessPermissionId(Long processPermissionId)
```

### Phase 3 - Training Integration and Validation
```java
// Training integration and validation methods
List<TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping> findByTrainedUser_ChecklistIdAndProcessPermissionId(Long checklistId, Long processPermissionId)
List<TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping> findByTrainedUser_FacilityIdAndProcessPermissionId(Long facilityId, Long processPermissionId)
Set<Long> findProcessPermissionIdsByTrainedUserId(Long trainedUserId)
Set<Long> findTrainedUserIdsByProcessPermissionId(Long processPermissionId)
```

This comprehensive documentation provides the foundation needed to implement an exact DAO layer replacement for the TrainedUserProcessPermissionMapping repository without JPA/Hibernate dependencies, while noting its current placeholder status and future training permission workflow potential.
