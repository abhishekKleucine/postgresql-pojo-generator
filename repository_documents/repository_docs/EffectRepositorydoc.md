## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Business Layer Analysis)

### Pattern: Action-Based Effect Management
```yaml
Usage: Effect management within action context for workflow automation
Purpose: "Manage action-scoped effects for workflow automation and external system integration"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Effects provide action-scoped automation capabilities enabling workflow automation and external system integration
  2. Action association ensures effect definitions are properly scoped and managed within action context
  3. Effect ordering enables proper effect execution sequence and workflow automation control
  4. API integration configuration enables external system integration and automated workflow processing
  5. Effect lifecycle management supports effect creation, modification, archival, and configuration management

Common Usage Examples:
  - effectRepository.findByActionId(actionId) in EffectService for action-specific effect management
  - effectRepository.findAllByActionsIdInOrderByOrderTree(actionIds) for bulk effect operations
  - effectRepository.save(effect) for effect lifecycle management and configuration updates
  - effectRepository.saveAll(effects) for bulk effect operations and ordering management
  - Effect archival and activation workflows for effect lifecycle control

Transaction: Required for persistence operations
Error Handling: ResourceNotFoundException, DataIntegrityViolationException, configuration errors
```

### Pattern: Effect Ordering and Revision Management
```yaml
Usage: Effect ordering management for revision operations and effect sequence control
Purpose: "Manage effect ordering and revision workflows for proper effect execution and workflow control"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Effect ordering enables proper effect execution sequence and workflow automation control
  2. Revision management requires bulk effect operations for effect updates and configuration management
  3. Order tree management enables effect hierarchy and execution sequence control for workflow automation
  4. Bulk effect operations enable efficient revision workflows and effect configuration management
  5. Effect ordering management supports workflow automation requirements and effect execution control

Common Usage Examples:
  - effectRepository.findAllByActionsIdInOrderByOrderTree(actionIds) in ChecklistRevisionService for revision operations
  - Effect ordering updates with order tree management for effect sequence control
  - Bulk effect operations for revision workflows and effect configuration management
  - Effect reordering operations for workflow automation and effect execution sequence management
  - Revision workflows with bulk effect updates and configuration management

Transaction: Required for bulk operations and ordering management
Error Handling: Bulk operation error handling and ordering validation
```

### Pattern: API Integration and External System Automation
```yaml
Usage: Effects for external system integration and automated workflow processing
Purpose: "Enable external system integration and automated workflow processing through effect configuration"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Effects enable external system integration through API configuration and automated workflow processing
  2. API configuration includes endpoint, method, payload, and headers for comprehensive external system integration
  3. JavaScript enablement supports custom automation logic and advanced workflow processing capabilities
  4. Effect type classification enables different automation patterns and external system integration approaches
  5. Query configuration enables data filtering and processing for external system integration workflows

Common Effect Patterns:
  - API endpoint configuration for external system integration and data transmission
  - API method and payload configuration for automated workflow processing and data management
  - API headers configuration for authentication and external system access control
  - Query configuration for data filtering and processing in automated workflows
  - JavaScript enablement for custom automation logic and advanced workflow processing
  - Effect type classification for different automation approaches and integration patterns

Transaction: Not Required for configuration access
Error Handling: API configuration validation and external system integration verification
```

## Transaction Requirements
```yaml
Read-Only Methods: 
  - findById, findAll, findAllByActionsIdInOrderByOrderTree, findByActionId
  - existsById, count, getReferenceById

Transactional Methods:
  - save, saveAll, delete, deleteById

Isolation Level: READ_COMMITTED (default)
Timeout: 30 seconds
Rollback: Exception.class (all exceptions trigger rollback)
```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml

  - DataIntegrityViolationException: 
    * NOT NULL constraint violations (actions_id, order_tree, type, name)
    * Foreign key violations (invalid actions_id references)

    * Invalid JSON format in query, apiEndpoint, apiPayload, apiHeaders fields
  - EntityNotFoundException: Effect not found by ID or criteria
  - OptimisticLockException: Concurrent effect modifications
  - InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Invalid query parameters or operations
  - JsonProcessingException: Invalid JSON in API configuration fields

Validation Rules:
  - action: Required, must reference existing action, immutable after creation

  - javascriptEnabled: Defaults to false, boolean for JavaScript automation capabilities

Business Constraints:
  - Effects must belong to valid actions for proper effect scoping and management

  - Effect types must be consistent with effect usage and automation requirements
  - Effect archival must maintain workflow integrity and automation consistency
