## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Business Layer Analysis)

### Pattern: Job Information Display with Annotations
```yaml
Usage: findByJobId(jobId) for job information and documentation display
Purpose: "Retrieve all job annotations for comprehensive job information display and documentation"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Job information display requires all job annotations for comprehensive job documentation and communication history
  2. Job annotations provide important job context including comments, remarks, and media attachments for job understanding
  3. Complete annotation listing enables job documentation completeness and communication tracking for operational requirements
  4. Job printing operations require all annotations for comprehensive job report generation and documentation
  5. Job annotation display supports job communication workflows and documentation requirements for operational excellence

Common Usage Examples:
  - jobAnnotationRepository.findByJobId(jobId) in JobService for job information display with annotations
  - Job printing workflows including all job annotations in printed reports and job documentation
  - Job information display with comprehensive annotation listing for job context and communication history
  - Job documentation operations requiring complete annotation information for operational requirements
  - Migration operations requiring job annotation data for system migration and data preservation

Transaction: Not Required
Error Handling: Returns empty list for jobs without annotations
```

### Pattern: Latest Annotation Management for Updates
```yaml
Usage: findLatestByJobId(jobId) for current annotation operations and updates
Purpose: "Access latest job annotation for annotation updates and media attachment management"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Latest annotation access enables annotation update operations including media attachment and remarks modification
  2. Current annotation management supports annotation enhancement workflows and media attachment operations
  3. Latest annotation operations enable annotation modification and update workflows for job documentation enhancement
  4. Current annotation access supports annotation management operations requiring latest annotation information
  5. Latest annotation management enables annotation update workflows and media attachment management for job documentation

Common Usage Examples:
  - jobAnnotationRepository.findLatestByJobId(jobId) in JobAnnotationService for annotation update operations
  - Latest annotation access for media attachment operations and annotation enhancement workflows
  - Current annotation management for annotation modification and update operations
  - Latest annotation retrieval for annotation management operations and documentation enhancement
  - Annotation update workflows requiring current annotation access for modification and media management

Transaction: Not Required for retrieval
Error Handling: Throws ResourceNotFoundException if no annotations found for job
```

### Pattern: Bulk Annotation Deletion for Job Cleanup
```yaml
Usage: deleteByJobId(jobId) for complete job annotation removal
Purpose: "Remove all job annotations for job cleanup and annotation lifecycle management"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Bulk annotation deletion enables complete job annotation removal for job cleanup and lifecycle management
  2. Job annotation cleanup supports job lifecycle operations and annotation management workflows
  3. Complete annotation removal enables job annotation lifecycle management and data cleanup operations
  4. Bulk deletion operations support job annotation management and cleanup workflows for operational requirements
  5. Annotation cleanup enables job lifecycle management with comprehensive annotation removal for data management

Common Usage Examples:
  - jobAnnotationRepository.deleteByJobId(jobId) in JobAnnotationService for complete annotation cleanup
  - Job annotation removal for job lifecycle management and annotation cleanup operations
  - Bulk annotation deletion for job annotation management and data cleanup workflows
  - Complete annotation removal for job cleanup and annotation lifecycle management
  - Job annotation cleanup operations for data management and annotation lifecycle workflows

Transaction: Required (@Transactional annotation)
Error Handling: DataIntegrityViolationException for foreign key constraint violations
```

## Transaction Requirements
```yaml
Read-Only Methods: 
  - findById, findAll, findByJobId, findLatestByJobId, findAll(Specification)
  - existsById, count, findOne(Specification), count(Specification)

Transactional Methods:
  - save, delete, deleteById, deleteByJobId

Isolation Level: READ_COMMITTED (default)
Timeout: 30 seconds
Rollback: Exception.class (all exceptions trigger rollback)
```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml
Common Exceptions:
  - DataIntegrityViolationException: 
    * Foreign key violations (invalid jobs_id references)
    * NOT NULL constraint violations (jobs_id, code)
    * Unique constraint violations on job annotation code
    * Cascade deletion failures with media mappings
  - EntityNotFoundException: Job annotation not found by ID or criteria
  - OptimisticLockException: Concurrent job annotation modifications
  - InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Invalid specification criteria or query parameters
  - ResourceNotFoundException: Job annotation not found during operations

Validation Rules:
  - remarks: Optional, text field for annotation comments and remarks
  - job: Required, must reference existing job, immutable after creation
  - code: Required, max length 20 characters, unique annotation identifier
  - medias: Optional, list of JobAnnotationMediaMapping objects for media attachments

Business Constraints:
  - Job annotation must belong to valid job for annotation association and job context
  - Annotation code must be unique for annotation identification and tracking
  - Media attachments must be properly associated with annotations for media management
  - Job annotation deletion must handle media mapping cascades for data integrity
  - Annotation updates must maintain job association for annotation context and tracking
  - Latest annotation operations must handle cases with no annotations gracefully
  - Bulk deletion operations must handle media mapping cleanup for data integrity
  - Annotation lifecycle management must maintain job context and annotation history
  - Media attachment operations must maintain annotation association for media tracking
  - Job annotation operations must respect job lifecycle and annotation management workflows
```

## Job Annotation-Specific Considerations

### Media Attachment Management
```yaml
Media Integration: Job annotations support media attachments through JobAnnotationMediaMapping
Cascade Operations: Media mappings are cascaded during annotation operations for data integrity
File Management: Media attachments require proper file management and storage handling
Media Lifecycle: Media attachments follow annotation lifecycle for media management
Access Control: Media access must be controlled based on annotation access permissions
```

### Annotation Lifecycle Management
```yaml
Creation: Job annotations are created with remarks and optional media attachments
Updates: Annotations can be updated with remarks modification and media attachment management
Latest Access: Latest annotation access supports current annotation operations and updates
Bulk Operations: Bulk deletion supports job cleanup and annotation lifecycle management
History: Annotation history is maintained through creation timestamps and annotation tracking
```

### Job Documentation Integration
```yaml
Job Context: Annotations provide important job documentation and communication context
Reporting: Annotations are included in job reports and printed documentation
Communication: Annotations support job communication workflows and team collaboration
Documentation: Annotations enhance job documentation with remarks and media attachments
Compliance: Annotation tracking supports compliance requirements and audit trail documentation
```

This comprehensive documentation provides the foundation needed to implement an exact DAO layer replacement for the JobAnnotation repository without JPA/Hibernate dependencies, focusing on job documentation and annotation management patterns.
