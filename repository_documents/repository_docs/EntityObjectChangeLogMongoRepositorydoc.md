```

## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Audit Requirements)

### Pattern: Entity Object Lifecycle Audit Trail
```yaml
Usage: Complete entity object lifecycle audit trail for change tracking and audit functionality
Purpose: "Track entity changes for comprehensive audit functionality and change processing"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Entity lifecycle audit management provides tracking functionality through change logging, audit management, and lifecycle operations
  2. Audit lifecycle includes change detection, log creation, and tracking management for audit control
  3. Audit management operations require tracking processing for audit lifecycle and change control
  4. Tracking operations enable comprehensive audit functionality with change capabilities and management
  5. Audit lifecycle management supports tracking requirements and functionality for entity change processing

Common Usage Examples:
  - entityObjectChangeLogRepository.save() for entity creation audit logging
  - Entity modification tracking with field-level change details
  - User action audit trail for accountability
  - Facility and organization scoped change tracking
  - Historical data preservation for compliance

Transaction: Not Required (MongoDB document-level consistency)
Error Handling: Entity audit error handling and change tracking validation verification
```

### Pattern: Compliance and Regulatory Audit Support
```yaml
Usage: Compliance and regulatory audit support for audit trail and regulatory functionality
Purpose: "Support compliance requirements for comprehensive audit functionality and regulatory processing"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Compliance audit management operations require comprehensive change log access for compliance-level audit management and regulatory functionality
  2. Compliance management supports regulatory requirements and functionality for audit processing workflows
  3. Compliance-level audit operations ensure proper regulatory functionality through audit management and compliance control
  4. Regulatory workflows coordinate compliance management with audit processing for comprehensive regulatory operations

Write Methods:
  - save, saveAll, delete, deleteById (MongoDB document-level consistency)

Transaction Support: MongoDB default consistency model
Isolation Level: MongoDB default consistency
Durability: MongoDB write concern configuration
Rollback: MongoDB document-level operations
```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml
Common Exceptions:
  - MongoException: MongoDB connection and operation failures
  - DocumentValidationException: Invalid change log structure
  - WriteTimeoutException: MongoDB write timeout for large change logs
  - NetworkException: MongoDB network connectivity issues

Validation Rules:
  - Change log must have valid entity object reference
  - Change timestamp must be valid for temporal ordering
  - Field changes must be properly structured for analysis
  - User information must be valid for accountability
  - Facility and organization context must be valid for scoping

Business Constraints:
  - Change logs must support audit trail requirements and functionality
  - Audit data must maintain referential integrity with entity objects
  - Change tracking must preserve historical accuracy and completeness
  - Audit logs must support compliance and regulatory requirements
  - Change log lifecycle management must maintain audit trail consistency
  - Audit operations must maintain data integrity and audit functionality
  - Change logs must support querying and analysis requirements
  - Audit data must maintain facility and organization scoping
  - Change tracking must support user accountability and audit requirements
  - Historical data must be preserved for compliance and analysis
