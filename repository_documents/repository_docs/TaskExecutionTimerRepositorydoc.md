## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Business Layer Analysis)

### Pattern: Task Pause/Resume Management
```yaml
Usage: Complete pause/resume lifecycle for task execution timing management and control
Purpose: "Manage task execution pause/resume operations for comprehensive timing functionality and task processing"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Task pause/resume management provides timing functionality through timer creation, state tracking, and resume operations
  2. Timer lifecycle includes timer creation, pause tracking, and resume workflows for timing control
  3. Timer management operations require task execution processing for timing lifecycle and execution control
  4. Task timing operations enable comprehensive execution functionality with timing capabilities and timer management
  5. Timer lifecycle management supports execution requirements and timing functionality for task timing processing

Common Usage Examples:
  - taskExecutionTimerRepository.findPausedTimerByTaskExecutionIdAndJobId() for pause state validation
  - taskExecutionTimerRepository.save() for pause timer creation and resume updates
  - taskExecutionTimerRepository.findAllByTaskExecutionIdIn() for bulk timer analysis
  - Comprehensive task timing management with pause/resume control and execution functionality

Transaction: Required for timer persistence operations
Error Handling: Task timing error handling and timer state validation verification
```

### Pattern: Timer State Tracking
```yaml
Usage: Timer state tracking for task execution timing analysis and reporting functionality
Purpose: "Track timer states for comprehensive timing analysis and execution functionality"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Timer state tracking operations require comprehensive timer access for execution-level timing analysis and timer functionality
  2. Timer tracking supports execution requirements and timing functionality for execution processing workflows
  3. Execution-level timer operations ensure proper timing analysis through timer management and execution control
  4. Execution workflows coordinate timer tracking with execution processing for comprehensive execution operations
  5. Timer tracking supports execution requirements and timing functionality for comprehensive execution timer management

Common Usage Examples:
  - taskExecutionTimerRepository.findAllByTaskExecutionIdIn() for bulk timer retrieval and analysis
  - Timer state analysis with comprehensive timer reporting and execution functionality
  - Execution timing analysis with timer state management and timing functionality

Transaction: Not Required for analysis operations
Error Handling: Timer analysis error handling and state validation verification
```

## Transaction Requirements
```yaml
Read-Only Methods: 
  - findById, findAll, findPausedTimerByTaskExecutionIdAndJobId, findAllByTaskExecutionIdIn
  - existsById, count

Transactional Methods:
  - save, saveAll, delete, deleteById

Isolation Level: READ_COMMITTED (default)
Timeout: 30 seconds
Rollback: Exception.class (all exceptions trigger rollback)
```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml
Common Exceptions:
  - DataIntegrityViolationException: 
    * NOT NULL constraint violations (task_executions_id, paused_at)
    * Foreign key violations (invalid task_executions_id references)
    * Timer integrity constraint violations
  - EntityNotFoundException: Task execution timer not found by ID or criteria
  - OptimisticLockException: Concurrent task execution timer modifications
  - InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Invalid query parameters or timer context
  - ConstraintViolationException: Task execution timer constraint violations

Validation Rules:
  - taskExecutionId: Required, must reference existing task execution for timer context
  - pausedAt: Required, timestamp when timer was paused
  - resumedAt: Optional, timestamp when timer was resumed (null indicates still paused)
  - reason: Optional, pause reason enum for tracking pause context
  - comment: Optional, additional pause context information

Business Constraints:
  - Only one active paused timer (resumedAt = null) should exist per task execution for proper timer integrity
  - Task execution reference must be valid for timer integrity and execution functionality
  - Timer lifecycle must support execution workflow requirements and timing functionality
  - Timer state management must maintain referential integrity and execution workflow functionality consistency
  - Timer operations must maintain transaction consistency and constraint integrity for execution management
  - Pause/resume operations must maintain timing functionality and timer consistency
  - Execution management must maintain timer integrity and execution workflow requirements
  - Timer state operations must ensure proper execution workflow management and timing control
```

## Task Execution Timer Considerations

```

### Performance and Audit Integration
```yaml
Audit Trail: Timer creation and modification tracking for timing audit functionality
Performance Tracking: Timer state management for execution performance analysis and comprehensive timing functionality
State Management: Timer state control for timing completion and state management functionality
Timing Metrics: Timer tracking with timing analysis and comprehensive timing functionality for timing workflows
Performance Analysis: Execution performance analysis with timer tracking and timing functionality for comprehensive timing management
```

This comprehensive documentation provides the foundation needed to implement an exact DAO layer replacement for the TaskExecutionTimer repository without JPA/Hibernate dependencies, focusing on task execution timing management and pause/resume control patterns.
