```

## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Business Layer Analysis)

### Pattern: Comprehensive Job Activity Auditing
```yaml
Usage: Extensive save() operations across all job-related activities
Purpose: "Comprehensive audit trail creation for all job lifecycle events and user actions"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Every job-related activity creates an audit entry including job creation, start, completion, and lifecycle changes
  2. All task-related activities are audited including task execution, pause, resume, completion, and assignment changes
  3. Parameter-related activities are comprehensively audited including value updates, corrections, validations, and variations
  4. User actions are tracked including task assignments, workflow modifications, and administrative actions
  5. System events are audited including automated actions, scheduled events, and system-triggered activities

Common Audit Categories:
  - Job Lifecycle: CREATE_JOB, START_JOB, COMPLETE_JOB, PRINT_JOB, SIGN_OFF_JOB
  - Task Operations: TASK_EXECUTION, TASK_PAUSE, TASK_RESUME, TASK_COMPLETION, TASK_ASSIGNMENT
  - Parameter Activities: PARAMETER_UPDATE, PARAMETER_CORRECTION, PARAMETER_VALIDATION, PARAMETER_VARIATION
  - User Actions: USER_ASSIGNMENT, WORKFLOW_MODIFICATION, ADMINISTRATIVE_ACTION
  - System Events: AUTOMATED_ACTION, SCHEDULED_EVENT, SYSTEM_TRIGGER

Transaction: Required for audit integrity and compliance
Error Handling: Comprehensive audit failure handling to ensure audit trail completeness
```

### Pattern: Job-Specific Audit History Retrieval
```yaml
Usage: findByJobIdOrderByTriggeredAtDesc(jobId) for job audit history
Purpose: "Retrieve complete chronological audit history for specific jobs for compliance and monitoring"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Job audit history provides complete activity timeline for job lifecycle monitoring and compliance reporting
  2. Chronological ordering enables proper activity sequence understanding and audit trail analysis
  3. Complete audit history supports compliance requirements and operational activity monitoring
  4. Job-specific audit retrieval enables focused audit analysis and job activity review
  5. Audit history supports investigation workflows and activity analysis for operational excellence

Common Usage Examples:
  - jobAuditRepository.findByJobIdOrderByTriggeredAtDesc(jobId) for complete job audit history
  - Job activity timeline display for operational monitoring and compliance reporting
  - Audit trail analysis for investigation workflows and activity review
  - Compliance reporting requiring complete job activity documentation
  - Operational monitoring requiring job activity tracking and analysis

Transaction: Not Required
Error Handling: Returns empty list for jobs without audit history
```

### Pattern: Advanced Audit Filtering and Reporting
```yaml
Usage: findAll(specification, pageable) for complex audit analysis
Purpose: "Advanced audit search and reporting with multi-criteria filtering for compliance and analysis"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Advanced audit filtering enables complex audit analysis and compliance reporting with multiple criteria
  2. Specification-based filtering supports audit discovery with user, time, action, and context-based criteria
  3. Pagination support enables efficient handling of large audit datasets for reporting and analysis
  4. Complex filtering enables targeted audit analysis for specific activities, users, and time periods
  5. Audit reporting supports compliance requirements and operational analysis with comprehensive filtering

Common Filtering Criteria:
  - Time-based filtering for specific audit periods and activity timeframes
  - User-based filtering for specific user activity tracking and analysis
  - Action-based filtering for specific activity types and audit categories
  - Job-based filtering for specific job activity analysis and monitoring
  - Organization-based filtering for multi-tenant audit analysis and reporting

Transaction: Not Required
Error Handling: Returns empty results for filter criteria with no matching audits
```

## Transaction Requirements
```yaml
Read-Only Methods: 
  - findById, findAll, findByJobIdOrderByTriggeredAtDesc, findAll(Specification)
  - existsById, count, findOne(Specification), count(Specification)

Transactional Methods:
  - save, saveAll, delete, deleteById

Isolation Level: READ_COMMITTED (default)
Timeout: 30 seconds
Rollback: Exception.class (all exceptions trigger rollback for audit integrity)
```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml
Common Exceptions:
  - DataIntegrityViolationException: 
    * NOT NULL constraint violations (organisationsId, triggeredBy, jobId, action)
    * Foreign key violations for job, stage, task references
    * Invalid enum values for action field
    * Invalid JSON format in parameters field
  - EntityNotFoundException: Job audit not found by ID or criteria
  - OptimisticLockException: Concurrent job audit modifications
  - InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Invalid specification criteria or query parameters
  - JsonProcessingException: Invalid JSON in parameters field

Validation Rules:
  - organisationsId: Required, must reference existing organisation for organizational context
  - triggeredBy: Required, must reference existing user for audit accountability
  - jobId: Required, must reference existing job for audit association
  - stageId: Optional, must reference valid stage when specified for stage-specific audits
  - taskId: Optional, must reference valid task when specified for task-specific audits
  - action: Required, must be valid Action.Audit enum value for audit categorization
  - details: Optional, descriptive text for audit activity description
  - parameters: Required, defaults to empty JSON object, must be valid JSON for audit parameters
  - triggeredAt: Optional, timestamp for audit timing (defaults to current time)

Business Constraints:
  - Job audit entries must maintain referential integrity with related entities for audit accuracy
  - Audit entries should be immutable once created for audit trail integrity and compliance
  - Audit deletion should be restricted or logged for audit trail preservation and compliance
  - Parameters must contain valid JSON for audit parameter tracking and analysis
  - Triggered timestamp must be accurate for chronological audit ordering and analysis
  - Audit entries must be created for all significant job activities for comprehensive tracking
  - Organizational context must be maintained for multi-tenant audit isolation and analysis
  - User accountability must be maintained through triggered_by field for audit responsibility
  - Stage and task context must be accurate when specified for detailed audit tracking
  - Audit action categorization must be consistent for audit analysis and reporting
```

## Audit-Specific Considerations

### Audit Trail Integrity
```yaml
Immutability: Audit entries should be immutable once created for integrity
Completeness: All significant activities must be audited for comprehensive tracking
Accuracy: Audit information must be accurate and verifiable for compliance
Retention: Audit entries must be retained per compliance requirements and policies
Security: Audit access must be controlled and monitored for security and compliance
```

### Compliance Requirements
```yaml
Regulatory Compliance: Audit trails must meet regulatory requirements for activity tracking
Data Integrity: Audit data must maintain integrity for compliance and operational requirements
Access Control: Audit access must be controlled and logged for security and compliance
Retention Policies: Audit retention must follow organizational and regulatory policies
Reporting: Audit data must support compliance reporting and analysis requirements
```

### Performance Considerations
```yaml
High Volume: Job auditing generates high volume of audit entries requiring performance optimization
Indexing: Proper indexing on jobId, triggeredAt, and action for efficient audit retrieval
Partitioning: Consider table partitioning for large audit datasets and performance optimization
Archiving: Implement audit archiving strategies for long-term retention and performance
Monitoring: Monitor audit performance and storage requirements for operational efficiency
```

This comprehensive documentation provides the foundation needed to implement an exact DAO layer replacement for the JobAudit repository without JPA/Hibernate dependencies, focusing on comprehensive audit trail management and compliance requirements.
