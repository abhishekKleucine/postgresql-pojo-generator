## Actual Usage Patterns (Based on Business Layer Analysis)

### Pattern: Exception Review Workflow Processing and Reviewer Management
```yaml
Usage: Complete parameter exception reviewer lifecycle for exception review workflows and approval management
Purpose: "Manage parameter exception reviewers for comprehensive exception review workflow processing and approval functionality"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Parameter exception reviewers provide exception review workflow processing through reviewer assignment and action tracking management
  2. Exception review processing lifecycle includes creation, assignment, review operations, and action tracking workflows
  3. Reviewer assignment operations require exception reviewer management for review processing and approval workflow control
  4. Exception review workflow operations enable comprehensive approval functionality with review processing capabilities and action tracking
  5. Reviewer lifecycle management supports exception requirements and approval functionality for exception review processing and compliance management

Common Usage Examples:
  - parameterExceptionReviewerRepository.findByExceptionId() in IParameterMapper for exception reviewer mapping during data transformation
  - parameterExceptionReviewerRepository.findByExceptionId() in ParameterExceptionService for reviewer validation and action tracking during review workflows
  - parameterExceptionReviewerRepository.saveAll() for bulk reviewer assignment during exception creation and review workflow setup
  - parameterExceptionReviewerRepository.save() for individual reviewer action tracking during exception review processing and approval workflows
  - Comprehensive exception review processing with reviewer lifecycle control and action tracking management for review workflow functionality

Transaction: Required for lifecycle operations and reviewer management

```

### Pattern: Reviewer Validation and Action Tracking Operations
```yaml
Usage: Exception reviewer validation workflows with action tracking and review processing for exception approval management

```

### Pattern: Exception Mapping and Data Transformation Operations
```yaml
Usage: Exception reviewer mapping operations for data transformation and exception information access
Purpose: "Map exception reviewers for comprehensive data transformation and exception information processing"

Business Logic Derivation:
  1. Exception mapping operations require reviewer information for comprehensive data transformation and exception information processing
  2. Reviewer mapping enables data transformation workflows with complete exception reviewer data for mapping operations and processing
  3. Exception reviewer mapping ensures proper data transformation and information access during mapping operations and processing

```

## Transaction Requirements
```yaml
Read-Only Methods: 
  - findById, findAll, findByExceptionId, existsById, count

Transactional Methods:
  - save, saveAll, delete, deleteById

```

## Error Handling & Constraints
```yaml
Common Exceptions:
  - DataIntegrityViolationException: 
    * NOT NULL constraint violations (user_groups_id, users_id, exceptions_id)
    * Foreign key violations (invalid user_groups_id, users_id, exceptions_id references)
    * Unique constraint violations for reviewer assignments
    * Exception reviewer assignment integrity constraint violations
  - EntityNotFoundException: Parameter exception reviewer not found by ID or criteria

  - exceptions: Required, must reference existing parameter exception, immutable after creation
  - exceptionId: Derived from exception relationship, immutable for exception context integrity
  - actionPerformed: Defaults to false, boolean for review action tracking and workflow state management

Business Constraints:
  - Parameter exception reviewers must be unique per user and exception for proper review workflow integrity
  - User group, user, and exception references must be valid for reviewer integrity and review functionality
  - Parameter exception reviewers must support exception review workflow requirements and approval functionality
  - Reviewer assignment lifecycle management must maintain referential integrity and review workflow functionality consistency
  - Action tracking management must ensure proper review workflow control and exception reviewer functionality
  - Exception reviewer associations must support review requirements and approval functionality for exception processing
  - Bulk operations must maintain transaction consistency and constraint integrity for reviewer management and exception processing
  - Reviewer lifecycle management must maintain exception review functionality and reviewer assignment consistency
  - Assignment management must maintain exception reviewer integrity and review workflow requirements for approval processing
  - Action tracking operations must ensure proper review workflow management and exception reviewer action control
```
