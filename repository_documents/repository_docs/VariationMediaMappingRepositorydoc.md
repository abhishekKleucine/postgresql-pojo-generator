  - InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: Invalid query parameters or composite key context
  - ConstraintViolationException: Variation media mapping constraint violations

Validation Rules:
  - variationMediaId: Required, composite key containing valid variation and media identifiers
  - variation: Required, must reference existing variation for media association
  - media: Required, must reference existing media for media attachment
  - archived: Boolean flag for media archive status, defaults to false

Business Constraints:
  - Variation media mappings should be unique per variation and media combination for proper media integrity
  - Variation and media references must be valid for media mapping integrity and variation functionality
  - Variation media mappings must support variation workflow requirements and media functionality
  - Media mapping lifecycle management must maintain referential integrity and variation workflow functionality consistency
  - Media mapping management must ensure proper variation workflow control and media functionality
  - Media mapping associations must support variation requirements and media functionality for variation processing
  - Media operations must maintain transaction consistency and constraint integrity for variation management
  - Media lifecycle management must maintain variation functionality and media consistency
  - Variation management must maintain media mapping integrity and variation workflow requirements
